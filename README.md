# 30 Days of Python Project

Welcome to my 30-day project aimed at improving my Python programming skills. Each day, I will be given a new coding challenge or exercise to complete, with the goal of building upon what I have learned in previous days.
Requirements

## To get started with the 30 Days of Python project, I will need:

* Basic knowledge of the Python programming language
* A Python interpreter (version 3.x is recommended)
* A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Getting Started

To begin, I can clone or download the project repository to my local machine:

bash

```bash
└─$ git clone https://github.com/bbgx/30-days-python.git
```

Each day's challenge or exercise will be presented in its own directory, with the directory name indicating the day number. To get started, I can navigate to the directory for the current day and follow the instructions in the README.md file.
